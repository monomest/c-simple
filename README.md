# C Simple: A multiplication questions program

A program that gives random multiplication questions.
This was my first program in a long while so it ain't that neat.

- Run from terminal
- Gives questions from 1x1 to 12x12
- Tells you how long you took
- Random questions
- Cute text-based feedback

Written for my little brother to practise his times tables.
